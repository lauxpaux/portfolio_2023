about me paraprapgh:
Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Laura, and I am a data scientist and machine learning engineer with 
two years of experience in the field. My passion for using data to solve complex problems has led me 
to work on a variety of projects, from natural phenomena in the ionosphere research at NASA to investigating happiness
arount the world.

As a data scientist, I have experience in data analysis, machine learning, statistical modeling, and 
data visualization. I am proficient in Python and SQL and I have
experience working with tools such as pandas, numpy, Scikit-Learn, matplotlib, seaborn, PostgreSQL and tensorflow.

I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams and stakeholders to understand business needs and 
provide data-driven solutions. I am always looking to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest 
advancements in the field of data science.

When I'm not working, I enjoy cooking, running, reading, and going to show. I also love to work on Data Chisme,
a blog for Latinas in tech or interested in tech that I co-founded with my friend Martha.

Thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio. I am excited about the opportunity to work with a 
team that shares my passion for using data to drive decision-making and create impactful solutions.
